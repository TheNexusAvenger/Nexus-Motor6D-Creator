# Nexus-Motor6D-Creator-Plugin
Nexus Motor6D Creator Plugin is a general-purpose utility for
creating `Motor6D`s in Roblox. Compared to `HingeConstraint`,
`Motor6D`s are a lot simpler and more efficient for ensuring
a part or assembly spins at a constant speed with low overhead.
`HingeConstraint` require physics replication, but are a lot
more configurable.
